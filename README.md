# VR-tour-of-NYC

A mini virtual tour of NYC's most visited spots. This project was done using React VR. A viewer can select a location by clicking on the
floating squares with images and it will take them to a virtual environment where they can click and drag around the area, or if using a
mobile device, can move device around them to see area.

In class React was one of our main focuses, so for this project I decided to explore the exciting world of React VR. I learned so much
while working on this project and was extremely happy for having the opportunity to branch out and play with a technology that I find so interesting 
and successfully create something in our four day deadline.

To check out this project:
1) Clone repo
2) npm install
3) npm start
4) Once you npm start, it will tell you where to open browser : http://localhost:8081/vr/ 

If your phone is on the same wireless network, replacing the 'localhost' with your computer's IP address will allow for a mobile experience.
So for example, instead of typing in something like 'http://localhost:8081/vr/' into your phone's browser, you would type in something that 
looks more like this, 'http://192.168.12.34:8081/vr/'. Now you can have the VR experience on your phone!
